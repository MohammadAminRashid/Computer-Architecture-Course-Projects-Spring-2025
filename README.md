# Computer-Architecture-Course-Projects-Spring-2025
README

This course consists of four projects:

1-Maze Solver – Implements search and backtracking to find a path to the target.

2-Single-Cycle Processor – Design and implementation of a single-cycle processor.

3-Multi-Cycle Processor – Extension of the design to a multi-cycle processor.

4-Pipelined Processor – Implementation of a pipelined processor.

These projects provide both algorithmic problem-solving experience and practical knowledge of processor design in computer architecture.
